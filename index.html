<p>Hi, my name is Donny. I'm a computer programmer in California. I've worked on digital services in healthcare and
  manufacturing.</p>

<p>At my jobs, I've worked with frontend technologies, like HTML, CSS, and React&mdash;and backend technologies like
  Node.js, Python & Django Web Framework, SQL and document databases, AWS, GCP, Docker, and shell scripting.</p>

<p>I want to focus on creating really good digital services.</p>
