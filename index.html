      <p><strong>Hi, my name is Donny</strong>, and I'm a computer programmer in California. I started working with code
        in 2015, and had my first professional experiences in 2018. At my jobs I've built ETL and database migration
        programs,
        websites and features for web apps, and software deployment tools.</p>

      <p>I'm looking for work in the San Francisco Bay Area. If you are reading this because of a link in a
        job application, please feel free to take a look at my resume, and look through my github, both linked to in the
        navigation.</p>
