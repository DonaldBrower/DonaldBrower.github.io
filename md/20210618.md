## Solutions to Problem Sets from JS: Hard Parts

Problem sets to help you understand the different features of JS:

- [Async function execution, callbacks, the callback queue](https://github.com/DonaldBrower/js-hardparts-solutions/tree/master/async)
- [JS Scope, variable environments, and programming with closure](https://github.com/DonaldBrower/js-hardparts-solutions/tree/master/closure)
- [Promises, deferring, the microtask queue](https://github.com/DonaldBrower/js-hardparts-solutions/tree/master/promise)
- [Object prototypes, the class syntax](https://github.com/DonaldBrower/js-hardparts-solutions/tree/master/oop)

The questions were created by someone at Codesmith, and the answers are ones that I wrote.

### Async

#### Debounce

```
function debounce(callback, interval) {
  let timer,
    readyToCall = true;

  /**
   *
   * @returns callback(), or "undefined" depending on if interval ms have ellapsed since last call to debouncedFunction
   */
  function debouncedFunction() {
    if (readyToCall) {
      readyToCall = false;

      timer = setTimeout(() => {
        readyToCall = true;
      }, interval);

      return callback();
    } else {
      // when debouncedFunction is not ready to be called,the timer running from the previous call should be resetâ€”making it "debouced three seconds from every call", instead of "debounded three seconds from every successful call"
      clearTimeout(timer);

      timer = setTimeout(() => {
        readyToCall = true;
      }, interval);

      return "unsucessful";
    }
  }

  return debouncedFunction;
}

function sayHi() {
  return "hi";
}

const debouncedSayHi = debounce(sayHi, 3000);

/* tests */

console.log(debouncedSayHi()); // -> 'hi'

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(debouncedSayHi());
}, 2000); // -> undefined

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(debouncedSayHi());
}, 4000); // -> undefined

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(debouncedSayHi());
}, 8000); // -> 'hi'

// ?? using iterm to run file, there is a second pause in between when cb for last setTimeout? I would expect it to just cut out right there

```
