## The Number of Atoms

[The code on GitHub](https://github.com/DonaldBrower/practice-questions/blob/master/number-of-atoms/3.number-of-atoms.js)

Here is a text processing challenge that we'll solve in JS. The Number of Atoms has us take an unsimplified chemical formula expression, and reduce it so all multiplicity groups are distributed, and repeat atoms in the formula are combined. See the following examples:

```
solve("Mg2(OH)2")  // H2O2Mg2

solve("HO2")  // H2O2

solve("Au(OKIP33)2")  // AuK66I66O66P66
```
